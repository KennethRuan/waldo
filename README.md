# Waldo

Waldo uses Adhawk's Eye-Tracking glasses to see where you are really looking while playing "Where's Waldo." After finding Waldo, we replay to you, live, the journey you took along the way and how dire it got at times. We'll highlight your vision path on the page so you can see how many times you glanced over ol' pal Waldo without realizing it and provide some insight into how much of the page you actually searched.
